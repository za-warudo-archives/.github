## Project Overview
Za Warudo Archives is kinda an educational website that aims to provide an interactive and immersive experience for exploring historical events, social sciences, kingdoms, etc., through maps. Our goal is to create a comprehensive platform where users can learn about various aspects of history, access accurate information, and contribute their knowledge. Lets understand the project overview by an example.
## Example : Joseph Stalin

When you search for "Joseph Stalin", Za Warudo Archives highlights the present-day Russia and displays the historical map of the USSR during Stalin's reign. You'll find a factual and unbiased description of Stalin and his legacy, along with proper citations for the information.

The website showcases the battles that took place during Stalin's leadership through cool animations. You can visualize the outcomes, whether he won or lost portions of the land. I think you got my point.

It's a brief description of my thoughts in my mind, and I don't know how it turns out in real life.

## Features
- **Interactive Globe Interface:** Explore historical events and locations using an interactive globe interface.
- **Search Functionality:** Search for historical figures, places, and events to retrieve relevant information.
- **Highlighting Historical Locations:** Highlight specific locations on the globe related to the searched queries. And with lots of cool maps!
- **Historical Maps:** Display historical maps corresponding to the time periods of interest. And again with lots of cooool maps!!(idk mann,Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯ i just want the project to have cool maps and look aesthetic!)
- **Detailed Descriptions:** Provide factual and unbiased descriptions of historical figures, their achievements, and legacies. Also provide citations for transparency.
- **Battles and Animations:** Visualize significant battles and territorial changes with interactive animations.
- **User Contributions(community):** Allow users to contribute their knowledge, correct inaccuracies, and share information about lesser-known kingdoms and history.

## Note
Alright, alright.. the project is still in the imagination phase and is far from becoming some kind of linux thing. I want to say here that whether I can pull this off or not, I will definetly try to do atleast the stalin example which i've mentioned above.

And any kind of advice or help is highly appreciated.(sponserships are very much appreciated :P cant guarantee the returns tho ðŸ˜—)
Anyways, have an amazing day ahead <3333
